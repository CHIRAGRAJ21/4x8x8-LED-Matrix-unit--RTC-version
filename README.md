# 4x8x8-LED-Matrix-Unit (RTC version)
 A wholly designed KiCad based project featuring a 4x8x8 LED Matrix unit, which for this particular variation is developed to function as a real time clock; hold four 8x8 LED matrix displays controlled by an Arduino Pro mini. The board also includes two push buttons to which you can assign arbitrary functions. This board also features a connector for USB to TTL Serial Adapter Module for Arduino Mini Port USB to Serial Interface Module CYT1007 and a connector for DS3231 IIC Precision RTC, such that every time arduino need not to be detached from the board for uploading of a new program or updating the former employing an external bridging device.

# FINISHED and ASSEMBLED PCB
